      Opening - Docking Bay: >-
        The Comet's Tail eased into docking bay seven with a pneumatic hiss, its repulsors powering
        down as Eva Rostova's practiced hands danced across the control panel. Through the viewport,
        New Vega Station sprawled before herâ€”a gleaming metal flower blooming in the void, petals of
        neon and starlight...
revision_notes: >-
  Strengthen Eva's personal stake in finding the treasure. Consider adding more tension in early
  chapters between her desire for independence and the growing realization that she can't solve
  this mystery alone.
writing_style_guide: >-
  Fast-paced and visual, with emphasis on action scenes and terse dialogue. Scientific elements
  should feel plausible but not overly technical.
tone_guide: >-
  Blend of optimism and grit. Characters face genuine dangers but ultimately the story should convey
  hope that determination and ingenuity can overcome seemingly impossible odds.
